# Python-Tools
On my journey to learn python, I will be putting my projects and scripts here for others to see and enjoy


// ALL PROJECTS HERE WILL HAVE COMPREHENSIVE COMMENTS ON THEM DESCRIBING MY PROCESS AND HOW THE CODE FITS INTO THE WIDER PENETRATION TESTING ENVIRONMENT
// CRITIQUE IS WELCOME, I AM LEARNING...

// SOME OF THESE PROJECTS ARE BASED ON TASKS SET BY THE ZSECURITY PYTHON COURSEWARE, WHERE I LEARN ABOUT A PARTICULAR TOPIC AND PUT THE THEORY TO PRACTISE BASED ON WHAT I HAVE LEARNED
// WHERE THIS IS THE CASE, I WILL ADD A COMMENT ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PROJECT SOURCING THE TASK AS ONE SET BY COURSEWORK

*** THE PROJECTS CANTAIN MY OWN CODE AND MY OWN AMENDMENTS, AND ARE NOT A LIFT FROM OTHER CODERS, HOWEVER SOME IDEAS AND INSIGHTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES **
